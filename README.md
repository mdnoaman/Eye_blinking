# Eye_blinking
Simple code to create blinking eye like effect

Extremely low cost project using Attiny 85. Two leds are tied directly to the IO pins. 
It controls each of the two leds seperately with variable on and off time. Each of the on and off effects are defined as function with input parameters making it easy to play with.
Creating the fading up and fading down effects with suitable rates make it appear like real eye-blinking effect.
Winking effects are also added for fun.

Overall it is a very small and quick solution for fun projects and can be added to larger projects. I used the "eyes" in a dummy which proved quite eye catchy.
