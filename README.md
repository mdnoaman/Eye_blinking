# Eye_blinking
Simple code to create blinking eye like effect

Extremely low cost project using Attiny 85. Two leds are tied directly to the IO pins. 
It controls each of the two leds seperately with variable on and off time. Additionally, the fading up and fading down effect with different rates make it look like real eye blinking effect.
Winking effects are also added for fun.

Overall it is a very small and quick solution for fun projects.
